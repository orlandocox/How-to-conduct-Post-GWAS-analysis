## 3. Variant Annotation

Once high-quality variants have been filtered, the next step in post-GWAS analysis is **variant annotation**. This process provides **biological context** to SNPs by determining their location, functional impact, and potential role in disease.

Variant annotation is crucial for **prioritizing SNPs for further analysis**, helping researchers differentiate between **associative** and **causative** variants.

### **3.1 What is Variant Annotation?**
**Variant annotation** is the process of assigning **biological meaning** to genetic variants by integrating them with **functional, regulatory, and disease-related data**.  

It helps answer key questions:
- **Where is the SNP located?** (coding region, intron, promoter, enhancer, etc.)
- **Does the SNP alter protein structure or function?**
- **Is the SNP associated with a known disease or trait?**
- **How common is the SNP in the population?** (Minor Allele Frequency, MAF)

#### **Types of Variant Annotations**
| **Annotation Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
|---------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Genomic Location** | Determines if the SNP is in a **coding, non-coding, or regulatory region**. | Exonic, intronic, UTR, intergenic |
| **Functional Impact** | Predicts how the SNP affects **gene expression or protein function**. | Missense, nonsense, synonymous |
| **Regulatory Potential** | Assesses if the SNP affects **promoters, enhancers, or splicing sites**. | eQTLs, TF binding sites |
| **Disease Association** | Links SNPs to known **disease-related genes**. | GWAS Catalog, ClinVar |
| **Conservation Score** | Measures evolutionary conservation to infer functional importance. | PhyloP, GERP++ |

### **3.2 Tools for Variant Annotation**
Several bioinformatics tools integrate **public databases** to annotate SNPs with functional and regulatory data. Below are some commonly used tools:

#### **1. ANNOVAR** (Annotation of Genetic Variants)
- One of the most widely used tools for **variant annotation and filtering**.
- Can assign **gene-based, region-based, and filter-based annotations**.
- Supports **multiple genome builds (hg19, hg38)**.
- Example command:
  ```bash
  table_annovar.pl input.vcf humandb/ -buildver hg19 -out output -remove -protocol refGene,dbnsfp35a -operation g,f
  ```
  
#### **2. SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant)**
- Predicts whether an **amino acid substitution** affects protein function.
- Scores range from **0 (deleterious) to 1 (tolerated)**.
- Example interpretation:
  - `SIFT Score = 0.02` → **Likely deleterious**
  - `SIFT Score = 0.95` → **Tolerated change**

#### **3. PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping v2)**
- Predicts the **functional impact** of missense mutations based on protein structure.
- Scores range from **0 (benign) to 1 (probably damaging)**.
- Example output:
  ```bash
  PolyPhen-2 Score: 0.89 (Possibly Damaging)
  ```

#### **4. VEP (Variant Effect Predictor)**
- A comprehensive tool by **Ensembl** for predicting variant effects.
- Provides **coding impact, regulatory features, and disease associations**.
- Example command:
  ```bash
  vep -i input.vcf --cache --dir_cache ~/.vep --species homo_sapiens --assembly GRCh38 --format vcf --output_file annotated.vcf
  ```

#### **5. dbNSFP (Database for Non-Synonymous Functional Predictions)**
- Aggregates predictions from **multiple tools** (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, MutationTaster).
- Useful for **cross-referencing functional predictions**.

### **3.3 Functional Interpretation of Variants**
Not all SNPs have the same biological impact. Some variants **change protein function**, while others have **neutral or regulatory roles**.

#### **Types of SNPs and Their Functional Impact**
| **Variant Type** | **Definition** | **Potential Consequence** | **Example** |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Synonymous** | Change in DNA sequence **without** altering the amino acid sequence. | Likely neutral, may affect mRNA stability. | `GGC → GGA (both code for Glycine)` |
| **Nonsynonymous (Missense)** | Change in DNA sequence **alters** the amino acid sequence. | May affect protein function or stability. | `GGC → AGC (Gly → Ser)` |
| **Nonsense** | Introduces a **premature stop codon**, truncating the protein. | Often leads to **loss-of-function**. | `TAC → TAA (Stop codon)` |
| **Frameshift** | Insertions/deletions shift the reading frame. | Disrupts protein structure. | `ATG → ATCG (shifted reading frame)` |
| **Splice Site** | Changes within **intron-exon junctions**. | Can alter RNA splicing. | `GT → GC (disrupts canonical splice site)` |

#### **Regulatory Variants**
Even if a SNP **does not alter protein coding**, it may still affect **gene regulation**:
- **Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs):** SNPs that alter gene expression levels.
- **Transcription Factor Binding Sites:** SNPs that change regulatory motifs.
- **Histone Modifications:** SNPs influencing chromatin accessibility.

Example: **rs1234567 in an enhancer region** → **Reduces expression of the lung disease gene MAP3K1**.

---

### **3.4 Example: Annotating a SNP**
A researcher identifies **rs3795503** as being significantly associated with **lung function (Forced Vital Capacity, FVC)**.  
Using **ANNOVAR, SIFT, and PolyPhen-2**, they annotate the variant:

```
Variant: rs3795503
Location: Exon 5 of KIAA1614 gene
Effect: Nonsynonymous (missense)
SIFT Score: 0.02 (Deleterious)
PolyPhen-2 Score: 0.91 (Probably Damaging)
```

#### **Interpretation**
- **This SNP is likely functionally relevant** since it **changes protein function** and is predicted to be **damaging**.
- **Further analysis is required** to confirm its impact on **lung function and disease susceptibility**.

### **3.5 What We Will Cover Next**
Now that we have **annotated SNPs and determined their potential effects**, the next sections will explore:
1. **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify pathways influenced by these variants.**
2. **Colocalization analysis to confirm whether SNPs affect both gene expression and disease risk.**
3. **Integration with external databases (e.g., Open Targets, GWAS Catalog) to validate variant-disease associations.**

By the end of this guide, you will be able to **functionally interpret genetic variants and prioritize SNPs for further investigation**.
