## 2. Understanding the Data: GWAS Results

Before conducting post-GWAS analysis, it is essential to understand the format of the data generated in GWAS. One of the most commonly used file formats for storing genetic variant data is the **Variant Call Format (.vcf)**. This file type contains detailed information about genetic variants, such as **Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, and deletions**, along with metadata describing the sequencing and variant calling process.

---

### **2.1 What is a `.vcf` File? (Variant Call Format Overview)**
A `.vcf` file is a standardized text file format used to store **genetic variant data**. It is widely used in **GWAS, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and exome sequencing** studies.

**Key Features of a `.vcf` File:**
- Stores information about **genetic variations** across individuals.
- Includes **chromosome position, reference and alternate alleles, genotype information, and quality scores**.
- Supports both **single-sample and multi-sample variant data**.
- Used as input for various bioinformatics tools such as **PLINK, bcftools, and GATK**.

---

### **2.2 Structure of a `.vcf` File**
A `.vcf` file consists of three main sections:
1. **Metadata Header (`##` lines)** – Contains information about the data source, reference genome, and tools used.
2. **Column Header (`#CHROM` line)** – Defines the structure of the variant data.
3. **Variant Data (tab-separated fields)** – Each row represents a genetic variant.

Example `.vcf` File:
##fileformat=VCFv4.2 

##source=GATK ##reference=hg19 

##contig=<ID=1,length=249250621> 

##INFO=<ID=AF,Number=A,Type=Float,Description="Allele Frequency"> 

##FORMAT=<ID=GT,Number=1,Type=String,Description="Genotype"> 

#CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT SAMPLE1 SAMPLE2 1 12345 rs1234 A G 99 PASS AF=0.01;DB;DP=100 GT 0|1 1|1


#### **Explanation of Key Columns:**
| **Column**  | **Description** |
|------------|---------------|
| `CHROM` | Chromosome number (e.g., 1, 2, X, Y). |
| `POS` | Genomic position of the variant. |
| `ID` | SNP identifier (e.g., **rsID from dbSNP**). |
| `REF` | Reference allele (the base in the reference genome). |
| `ALT` | Alternative allele(s) (the variant found in the sample). |
| `QUAL` | Quality score of the variant call. |
| `FILTER` | Whether the variant passed filtering criteria (`PASS` or `FAIL`). |
| `INFO` | Additional data, such as **allele frequency (AF), depth (DP), and functional annotations**. |
| `FORMAT` | Specifies genotype-related information (e.g., `GT` for genotype). |
| `SAMPLE1, SAMPLE2` | Individual genotype data (e.g., `0|1` heterozygous, `1|1` homozygous variant). |

---

### **2.3 Why is a `.vcf` File Important for GWAS and Post-GWAS Analysis?**
A `.vcf` file is critical for **storing and analyzing genetic variation data** in GWAS studies. It serves multiple purposes in **post-GWAS analysis**, including:

- **Filtering Variants for Analysis:**  
  - Variants are filtered based on **allele frequency, quality scores, and functional annotations**.
  
- **Variant Annotation & Functional Interpretation:**  
  - `.vcf` files are used as input for **variant annotation tools** like ANNOVAR and VEP.
  
- **Linking Variants to Disease Risk:**  
  - Variant data can be integrated with external resources like **GTEx (eQTL analysis)** and **GWAS Catalog**.
  
- **Colocalization & Causal Inference:**  
  - Helps determine if variants affect **gene expression and disease risk** through colocalization analysis.

---

### **2.4 How to Work with `.vcf` Files in Bioinformatics**
Several tools are available for handling `.vcf` files:

| **Task** | **Tool** | **Command Example** |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| View `.vcf` file contents | `bcftools` | `bcftools view file.vcf` |
| Convert `.vcf` to PLINK format | `plink` | `plink --vcf file.vcf --make-bed --out output` |
| Filter variants by quality | `vcftools` | `vcftools --vcf file.vcf --minQ 30 --recode --out filtered` |
| Annotate variants | `ANNOVAR` | `table_annovar.pl file.vcf humandb/ -buildver hg19` |

### **2.5 What We Will Cover Next**
Now that we understand `.vcf` files and their role in GWAS, the next sections will explore:
1. **How to filter and preprocess GWAS summary statistics.**
2. **How to annotate and interpret variants using external databases.**
3. **How to integrate `.vcf` files into post-GWAS analysis for deeper biological insights.**

By the end of this guide, you will be able to **interpret, process, and analyze genetic variants from `.vcf` files** to extract meaningful information for post-GWAS research.




## 2.2 GWAS Summary Statistics: Interpreting Key Metrics like p-values, Effect Sizes, and Allele Frequencies

Once a Genome-Wide Association Study (**GWAS**) is performed, the results are typically provided in the form of **summary statistics**. These statistics contain essential information about the relationship between genetic variants (SNPs) and the trait or disease being studied.

**Understanding these key metrics is crucial for filtering variants, prioritizing SNPs for post-GWAS analysis, and identifying meaningful biological insights.**

---

### **2.2.1 What Are GWAS Summary Statistics?**
GWAS summary statistics are **tabular datasets** that report the strength and significance of association between **millions of SNPs** and a trait of interest. Each row typically represents a **single genetic variant (SNP)**.

#### **Example GWAS Summary Statistics File:**
SNP CHR POS REF ALT PVAL BETA SE MAF

rs12345 1 1234567 A G 3.21e-10 -0.25 0.05 0.12

rs67890 2 7654321 C T 0.034 0.18 0.07 0.45


#### **Key Columns and Their Meanings:**
| **Column** | **Description** |
|------------|---------------|
| `SNP` | The unique identifier of the variant (e.g., rsID from dbSNP). |
| `CHR` | Chromosome number where the SNP is located. |
| `POS` | Position of the SNP on the chromosome (base pair location). |
| `REF` | Reference allele (the base in the reference genome). |
| `ALT` | Alternative allele (the variant found in individuals). |
| `PVAL` | p-value: Measures the **statistical significance** of the association. |
| `BETA` | Effect size: Indicates the **direction and magnitude** of the SNP’s effect. |
| `SE` | Standard error: Measures **uncertainty** in the effect size estimate. |
| `MAF` | Minor Allele Frequency: The frequency of the less common allele in the population. |

---

### **2.2.2 Interpreting Key Metrics**
#### **1. p-value (PVAL) – Statistical Significance**
- The **p-value** represents the probability that the observed association occurred **by chance**.
- A **lower p-value** indicates **stronger evidence** that a SNP is associated with the trait.
- In GWAS, a standard threshold for **genome-wide significance** is:
  - **p < 5 × 10⁻⁸** (to account for multiple testing of millions of SNPs).
- Example Interpretation:
  - `p = 3.21e-10` → **Highly significant SNP** (strong evidence of association).
  - `p = 0.034` → **Not genome-wide significant**, but may still be relevant.

#### **2. Effect Size (BETA) – Strength & Direction of Effect**
- The **effect size (BETA coefficient)** represents the **estimated impact** of the SNP on the trait.
- A **positive BETA value** means the **alternative allele (ALT) increases the trait value**.
- A **negative BETA value** means the **alternative allele decreases the trait value**.
- Example Interpretation:
  - `BETA = -0.25` → This SNP **reduces** the trait value.
  - `BETA = 0.18` → This SNP **increases** the trait value.
- Effect sizes can vary widely. Large values may indicate **strong effects**, while small values may still be biologically relevant if **highly significant (low p-value)**.

#### **3. Standard Error (SE) – Precision of the Effect Size**
- The **standard error (SE)** reflects **how precise** the estimated effect size is.
- A **smaller SE** means the effect size is **more reliable**.
- The **z-score** (BETA / SE) is sometimes used to compare SNP effects.

#### **4. Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) – Variant Frequency in the Population**
- The **Minor Allele Frequency (MAF)** indicates how common the **alternative allele (ALT)** is in the population.
- **Common variants:** MAF > 5%
- **Rare variants:** MAF < 1%
- Example Interpretation:
  - `MAF = 0.12` → 12% of the population carries the alternative allele.
  - `MAF = 0.003` → Rare variant, may have a stronger effect.

---

### **2.2.3 How These Metrics Influence Post-GWAS Analysis**
| **Metric** | **How It’s Used in Post-GWAS Analysis** |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| **p-value (PVAL)** | Determines **significant** SNPs for follow-up analysis. |
| **Effect Size (BETA)** | Helps prioritize **strongly associated** variants. |
| **Standard Error (SE)** | Ensures **reliable** SNP associations. |
| **Minor Allele Frequency (MAF)** | Identifies **rare variants**, which may have larger effects. |

---

### **2.2.4 Example: Selecting SNPs for Further Analysis**
A researcher is analyzing GWAS results for **lung function (Forced Vital Capacity - FVC)**. They identify the following SNPs:

| **SNP** | **CHR** | **POS** | **REF** | **ALT** | **PVAL** | **BETA** | **SE** | **MAF** |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| rs54321 | 5 | 9876543 | G | A | 2.4e-12 | -0.40 | 0.04 | 0.10 |

| rs99999 | 7 | 3456789 | T | C | 8.0e-6 | 0.15 | 0.05 | 0.42 |

| rs77777 | 12 | 1122334 | C | G | 0.12 | 0.02 | 0.02 | 0.08 |


- **rs54321** is highly significant (`p = 2.4e-12`), has a **large negative effect (-0.40)**, and is a **moderately common variant (MAF = 0.10)**.  
  → This SNP is a **high-priority candidate for functional studies**.  
- **rs99999** is less significant (`p = 8.0e-6`), has a **smaller effect (0.15)**, and is **common (MAF = 0.42)**.  
  → This SNP may still be relevant but requires **further validation**.  
- **rs77777** is **not significant (`p = 0.12`)** and has a **tiny effect size (0.02)**.  
  → This SNP is **unlikely to be important** and may be filtered out.

Now that we understand GWAS summary statistics, the next sections will explore:
1. **How to filter and preprocess GWAS summary statistics to remove unreliable SNPs.**
2. **How to integrate summary statistics with external databases to validate findings.**

By the end of this guide, you will be able to **interpret, filter, and analyze GWAS summary statistics** to extract meaningful insights for genetic research.



## 2.3 Quality Control and Filtering of Variants: How to Remove Low-Quality Variants

Before conducting post-GWAS analysis, it is essential to apply **quality control (QC) filters** to remove **low-quality or spurious variants** from the dataset. GWAS data often contains **genotyping errors, sequencing artifacts, and false-positive associations**, which can introduce bias and reduce the reliability of downstream analyses.

**Quality control ensures that only high-confidence genetic variants are used in post-GWAS analysis, improving the accuracy of functional interpretation and variant prioritization.**

---

### **2.3.1 Why Is Quality Control Important?**
Raw GWAS data contains millions of SNPs, but **not all of them are reliable**. Poor-quality SNPs can arise due to:
- **Sequencing errors** from genotyping arrays or next-generation sequencing.
- **Low call rates**, where a SNP is missing in a large number of samples.
- **Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)**, which may indicate genotyping errors.
- **Rare variants with very low Minor Allele Frequency (MAF)**, which may lack statistical power.
- **Poor imputation quality**, leading to uncertain genotype calls.

Applying QC filters helps remove **false positives** and increases confidence in **true associations**.

---

### **2.3.2 Key Quality Control Filters**
To ensure high-quality variants, researchers apply the following **QC thresholds**:

| **Filter** | **Purpose** | **Common Threshold** |
|------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Call Rate / Missingness** | Removes SNPs with too many missing genotype calls. | SNP missingness < 5% (`--geno 0.05`) |
| **Minor Allele Frequency (MAF)** | Removes extremely rare variants with little statistical power. | MAF > 0.01 (`--maf 0.01`) |
| **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) Test** | Identifies SNPs with deviations that may indicate genotyping errors. | p > 1 × 10⁻⁶ (`--hwe 1e-6`) |
| **Genotyping Quality Score (GQ)** | Ensures high-confidence genotype calls. | GQ > 20 |
| **Imputation Quality Score (INFO Score)** | Ensures accurately imputed variants. | INFO > 0.8 |

---

### **2.3.3 Step-by-Step Quality Control Using PLINK**
**PLINK** is one of the most commonly used tools for GWAS data processing and quality control.

#### **1. Remove SNPs with High Missingness**
plink --bfile input_data --geno 0.05 --make-bed --out filtered_data
this removes SNPs with a **call rate below 95%.**

### 2. filter by minor allele frequency (MAF)
plink --bfile filtered_data --maf 0.01 --make-bed --out maf_filtered_data
this removes SNPs where the minor allele frequency (MAF) is below 1%

### Apply Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) Test
plink --bfile maf_filtered_data --hwe 1e-6 --make-bed --out hwe_filtered_data
This removes SNPs that deviate significantly from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE p < 1 × 10⁻⁶).

### 4. Filter Variants by Imputation Quality (if using imputed data)
bcftools filter -i 'INFO>0.8' -o imputation_filtered.vcf input_data.vcf
This removes poorly imputed variants with an INFO score below 0.8.

## 2.3.4 Identifying and Removing Poor-Quality Samples
In addition to filtering SNPs, we must also remove low-quality individuals from the dataset.

Metric	Purpose	Common Threshold	PLINK Command
Sample Call Rate	Removes individuals with too many missing genotypes.	Missing rate < 5%	--mind 0.05
Heterozygosity Rate	Identifies sample contamination or genotyping errors.	±3 SD from mean	plink --het
Relatedness (IBD)	Removes closely related individuals (e.g., duplicates, siblings).	pi-hat < 0.2	plink --genome

Example command to remove samples with high missingness:
plink --bfile hwe_filtered_data --mind 0.05 --make-bed --out final_filtered_data

## 2.3.5 Visualizing Quality Control Results
It is important to visualize QC metrics before finalizing the dataset.

- Missingness Plot: Shows distribution of missing genotypes.
- MAF Distribution: Ensures no systematic bias in allele frequencies.
- Heterozygosity Plot: Identifies samples with unusually high or low heterozygosity.
- PCA Plot: Ensures population stratification is accounted for.
- Generating a PCA Plot for Population Stratification
plink --bfile final_filtered_data --pca 20 --out pca_results
This helps detect hidden population structure, which can introduce bias in GWAS.

## 2.3.6 Summary: Best Practices for Variant Filtering
Step	Action	Threshold
Step 1	Remove SNPs with high missingness	--geno 0.05
Step 2	Remove low-frequency SNPs	--maf 0.01
Step 3	Filter Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium violations	--hwe 1e-6
Step 4	Remove low-quality samples (missingness, heterozygosity)	--mind 0.05
Step 5	Perform PCA to control for population structure	--pca 20
