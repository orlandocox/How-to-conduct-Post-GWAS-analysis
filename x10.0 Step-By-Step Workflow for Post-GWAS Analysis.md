## 10. Step-by-Step Workflow for Post-GWAS Analysis  

Post-GWAS analysis involves multiple steps to **filter, annotate, validate, and prioritize genetic variants** for biological and clinical interpretation.  
This section provides a **step-by-step workflow** to guide researchers through the **essential stages** of post-GWAS analysis, from **preprocessing data** to **prioritizing SNPs for therapeutic research**.  

---

### **10.1 Preprocessing Data: Filtering Variants**  

Before conducting post-GWAS analysis, it is crucial to **remove low-quality variants** to improve **data reliability**.  
**Common filtering steps include:**  

1. **Remove variants with high missingness** (`--geno 0.05` in PLINK).  
2. **Filter out SNPs with low Minor Allele Frequency (MAF)** (`--maf 0.01`).  
3. **Apply Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) filtering** (`--hwe 1e-6`).  
4. **Perform population structure adjustment** using PCA to remove ancestry-related confounders.  

**Example PLINK command for quality control:**  
```bash
plink --bfile input_data --geno 0.05 --maf 0.01 --hwe 1e-6 --make-bed --out filtered_data
```

After filtering, the **high-confidence variants** are retained for **downstream analysis**.

### **10.2 Performing Variant Annotation: Tools and Approaches**  

Once high-quality variants are selected, they must be **annotated** to determine their **biological significance**.  

#### **Key Steps in Variant Annotation:**  
1. **Identify genomic location (coding, intronic, regulatory regions).**  
2. **Determine functional impact (missense, nonsense, synonymous mutations).**  
3. **Predict pathogenicity using computational tools.**  

#### **Commonly Used Annotation Tools:**  
| **Tool** | **Purpose** | **Command Example** |  
|---------|------------|---------------------|  
| **ANNOVAR** | Functional annotation of variants | `table_annovar.pl input.vcf humandb/ -buildver hg19` |  
| **VEP (Variant Effect Predictor)** | Identifies coding impact and regulatory effects | `vep -i input.vcf --cache --species homo_sapiens` |  
| **SIFT & PolyPhen-2** | Predicts whether SNPs are damaging | `dbNSFP annotation` |  

**Example VEP output:**  
```bash
rs3795503 | Exon 5 | Missense | PolyPhen2: Probably Damaging (0.91)
```

After annotation, SNPs with **strong functional implications** can be **prioritized for further analysis**.

### **10.3 Conducting Gene Set Enrichment Analysis: How to Validate Findings**  

**Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)** identifies whether the genes near significant GWAS hits are **overrepresented in biological pathways**.  

#### **Steps in Gene Set Enrichment Analysis:**  
1. Convert **significant SNPs** to **associated genes**.  
2. Perform **pathway enrichment** using databases like **KEGG, Reactome, and Enrichr**.  
3. Interpret enriched pathways for **biological relevance**.  

#### **Common Tools for GSEA:**  
| **Tool** | **Purpose** | **Command Example** |  
|---------|------------|---------------------|  
| **Enrichr** | Quick online pathway analysis | Upload gene list to [Enrichr](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/) |  
| **ClusterProfiler (R package)** | KEGG and Reactome enrichment | `enrichKEGG(gene = gene_list, organism = "hsa")` |  
| **GSEA (Broad Institute)** | Standard gene enrichment pipeline | `java -cp gsea.jar xtools.gsea.Gsea -res data.gct` |  

**Example Interpretation of GSEA Results:**  
| **Pathway** | **p-value** | **Odds Ratio** |  
|------------|------------|---------------|  
| KEGG: Insulin signaling | `3.2e-5` | `2.8` |  
| Reactome: MAPK cascade | `6.5e-4` | `2.1` |  
| GWAS Catalog: Asthma genes | `2.1e-3` | `1.9` |  

Pathways with **low p-values and high odds ratios** are **likely biologically relevant** and should be **prioritized for further study**.

### **10.4 Colocalization Analysis: Linking Variants to Genes**  

To determine whether **a GWAS variant is truly causal**, **colocalization analysis** is performed.  
This tests whether a **SNP affects both a disease and gene expression (eQTLs)**.  

#### **Steps in Colocalization Analysis:**  
1. Obtain **GWAS summary statistics** and **eQTL data** from GTEx or QTL databases.  
2. Use **Bayesian colocalization methods** (e.g., `coloc` R package) to determine shared causality.  
3. Interpret posterior probabilities (**PP4 > 0.8 indicates strong colocalization**).  

#### **Example `coloc` R Workflow:**  
```r
library(coloc)
coloc_results <- coloc.abf(dataset1 = gwas_list, dataset2 = eqtl_list)
print(coloc_results$summary)
```

#### **Example Output:**  
```r
PP.H4 = 0.85  # Strong evidence that the same SNP drives both traits.
```

A **high PP.H4** suggests that the SNP is a **causal regulatory variant**, linking the **genetic association to gene expression**.

### **10.5 Integrating External Data: Using Databases to Validate and Contextualize**  

External databases help **validate GWAS findings** by cross-referencing **known genetic associations**.  

#### **Key External Databases:**  
| **Database** | **Purpose** | **Access** |  
|-------------|------------|------------|  
| **GWAS Catalog** | Checks if SNPs were previously associated with diseases | [GWAS Catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) |  
| **Open Targets** | Links genes to diseases and drugs | [Open Targets](https://platform.opentargets.org/) |  
| **STRING** | Identifies protein-protein interactions | [STRING](https://string-db.org/) |  
| **DGIdb** | Drug-gene interaction database | [DGIdb](https://www.dgidb.org/) |  

By comparing **new GWAS results** with **known disease-associated SNPs**, researchers can confirm whether **findings are novel or support existing genetic evidence**.

### **10.6 Prioritizing SNPs: Selecting Targets for Therapeutic Research**  

Once SNPs have been **filtered, annotated, validated, and cross-referenced**, the final step is to **prioritize variants for further study**.  

#### **Criteria for Prioritizing SNPs for Experimental Validation:**  
| **Criterion** | **Why It Matters** |  
|-------------|------------------|  
| **Colocalization with eQTLs** | Confirms SNP’s functional role in gene regulation |  
| **Pathway Enrichment** | Indicates SNP’s involvement in disease-related pathways |  
| **Drug Targetability** | Prioritizes genes that are already druggable |  
| **Replication in Multiple Studies** | Reduces the risk of false positives |  

**Example Prioritization of MAP3K1 for Therapeutic Targeting:**  
- **GWAS evidence:** MAP3K1 associated with lung function.  
- **Colocalization:** MAP3K1 SNPs affect gene expression in lung tissue.  
- **Drug Targetability:** MAP3K1 inhibitors (E-6201, Trametinib) exist.  
- **Actionable Insight:** MAP3K1 is a **high-priority candidate for experimental validation in lung disease.**
