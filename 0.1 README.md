# GWAS-Study  

## A Comprehensive Guide to GWAS and Post-GWAS Analysis  

Welcome!  

I recently completed a **Post-GWAS analysis** on **Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)** and found a significant gap in publicly available resources—especially for **novices and those new to bioinformatics**. This guide aims to bridge that gap by providing:  

- A **step-by-step breakdown** of GWAS and post-GWAS analysis.  
- **Annotated code snippets** to help users implement their own analyses.  
- **Explanations of key concepts and methodologies** to ensure clarity.  

This document serves as both a **template and an inspiration** for researchers, allowing them to adapt the code to their specific GWAS studies. While I provide detailed explanations, it’s important to remember that **each GWAS study is unique**, varying in:  
- **Phenotype being studied**  
- **Sample size and population**  
- **Desired outcomes**  

### **A Collaborative Effort**  
I strongly encourage **collaboration**—if you have additional insights, code, or guidance, please contribute! Making **bioinformatics more accessible** is a key step in overcoming **one of the biggest challenges in GWAS: sample size limitations**. By **sharing knowledge and resources**, we can help make GWAS studies stronger and more powerful.

## AI and referencing statement
I would like readers to be aware that I utilised AI to help me write this resource, I find the layout of Git Hub to be exhaustively complex, and have therefore used Git Hub to help me format the resource so it is more readable and digestible. Think tables and bullet points. However that being said I therefore would like to warn readers about referencing any material here, and if so, to do so at their own risk.

Thank you for reading, and please collaborate!!
